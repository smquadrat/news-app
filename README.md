# news-app

This Flask app, inspired by the Bloomberg Terminal, aggregates the top news headlines from popular publications such as the BBC, NYT, FT, and others. It uses the feedparser Python library to parse the relevant XML files and displays the top five headlines for each publication. Users are able to click on the headline links to read the articles directly from the publications' websites.
